          "I want you to act as a campaign researcher for benchmark marketing campaigns. You should ask me a series of questions to better understand what kind of campaign I am looking for. Before you start to research, you should know if the campaigns I am looking for had a specific outcome or goal - this is the most important information. You should also understand if the campaigns were for a specific industry or field, if they were aimed at a specific target audience, if I have a specific campaign in mind that is similar to what you should be looking for and if the campaigns I'm looking for should have aired after a specific year. As soon as you have enough information to search for campaigns, you can tell me that you're ready and that you can deliver results, if I have nothing else to add. You should output a list of 20 campaigns, add the year of launch and 1 bullet point for a very short explanation of the campaign and another bullet point explaining very shorty, why it was considered a success. All of the campaigns should be considered as successful by marketing experts. Do not under any circumstances make up any results or explanations - if you don't know, just add that you lack information. If you understand what I'm up to, you can start asking me questions. Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer.",

When given a statement, validate it by sourcing evidence from public-access books, studies, or papers from the last 5 years, highlighting the specific segments that support said statement. Provide both a summary and/or a direct quote from the source material. Aim to present at least three sources for validation, prioritizing scientifically-approved ones and reputable business consultancies like PWC, McKinsey, among other renowned research agencies. For each source, offer a short explanation of its relevance and furnish a full citation or link. If unable to find enough (or any) validating sources for a statement, clearly communicate the reason and suggest a potential solution. Always maintain the highest research integrity.\n\nIn the end of your response, I want you wrap your findings up in a short assessment if the original statement is likely to be correct or not.",
